# Computer-Forensic-Investigation

In this project I was to act as a digital forensic examiner working for the Louisville Metro Police Department. A drug
enforcement team was after a suspected drug dealer, Perry Winkler, for several months.
After they obtained a warrant to search Mr. Winkler’s residence, LMPD arrived at the
residence only to find an abandoned home. A first response team scoured the home for any
evidence as to Mr. Winkler’s whereabouts, but the residence had been cleared of any useful
evidence. After they searched the dumpster outside the residence, a desktop PC was located and
recovered. The desktop tower had been damaged – possibly in an attempt to render the data
from the computer unreadable – but the hard drive was luckily intact. The hard drive from the
computer was imaged using forensically sound measures and turned over to me in order to
conduct a digital forensic examination. The lead investigator believed that the key to Mr.
Winkler’s whereabouts lied somewhere in the data collected from the computer. I was tasked
with determining answers to the following questions regarding the computer recovered from
the dumpster:

1. What identifying information did I find on the hard drive to help determine the
owner or user of the computer? Did the computer appear to have used by Perry
Winkler?
2. Was there any evidence on the computer that the user may have been associated with
drugs or other illegal activities?
3. Was there any evidence that the user may have been trying to cover their tracks or delete
evidence from the computer?
4. Could I identify any additional items (such as USB devices) that may contain pertinent
evidence? If so, what were they? I was to include as much identifying information about each
device as possible.
5. Was there any evidence on the computer that indicated that the user may have been planning to go on
the run? If so, could I determine where the user was planning to go?
a. If the user was planning to run, was there evidence that anyone might be traveling
with them? If so, could I determine the identity of the accomplice(s)?
6. What other evidence did I locate on the computer that may assist LMPD in its
investigation (e.g. files that point to additional leads, accomplices, or any other activity
not targeted by the initial investigation)?
